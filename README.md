- 👋 Hi, I’m @LanceBBongon
- 👀 I’m interested in Programing and all Technology things related because of how it leverages and enhances our lives as we walk and subdue the earth.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of javascript for a project. More specifically rediscovering javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on projects worthwhile doing. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Prefer to keep my self private and have like separation of concern of MVC for social life. Try reaching me in github.
- 😄 Pronouns: God said there are male and female. So, I am male. God then also said love thy neighbor as love thy self. So I got nothing against people having pronouns and I'll respect that.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. The Bible has been authored by different individuals, but the miracle of that book lies in the fact that it was not written by just one man who influences people. Instead, it was written by several authors, each with different intentions, who could have described their own character. Yet, the Bible instead describes God's character and His intent for His people.
