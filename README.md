- 👋 Hi, I’m @LanceBBongon
- 👀 I’m interested in Programing and all Technology things related because of how it leverages and enhances our lives as we walk and subdue the earth.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of javascript for a project. More specifically rediscovering javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on projects worthwhile doing. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Prefer to keep my self private and have like separation of concern of MVC for social life. Try reaching me in github.
- 😄 Pronouns: God said there are male and female. So, I am male. God then also said love thy neighbor as love thy self. So I got nothing against people having pronouns and I'll respect that.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Jesus is the way the truth and the life. The bible has been held by different authors
